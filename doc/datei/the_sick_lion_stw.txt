Lion end days lay sick death 
mouth cave  gasping breath   animals  
subjects  round drew nearer grew 
helpless   point death thought 
themselves: "Now time pay grudges "  Boar 
drove tusks  Bull gored 
horns  Lion lay helpless them: 
Ass  feeling safe danger   turning tail 
Lion kicked heels face   "This double 
death " growled Lion  
 
cowards insult dying majesty
